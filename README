🐔 Project Title:
Transfer Learning-Based Classification of Poultry Diseases for Enhanced Health Management

🎯 Objective
To develop an efficient image classification system using transfer learning that detects poultry diseases based on images of poultry droppings or visible symptoms.
✅ The goal is to help farmers identify diseases early and manage flock health effectively, even in rural areas.

❗ Problem Statement
Poultry diseases like Newcastle Disease, Coccidiosis, and Salmonella cause significant economic losses in the poultry industry.

In rural or resource-limited settings, veterinary support is not always available. A fast, automated image classification system can provide immediate diagnosis, enabling better disease control and reduced mortality.
